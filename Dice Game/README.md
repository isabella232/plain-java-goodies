* Version 1 (welleydicev1) is the simple version that satisfies the basic rules of CRAPS given in the assignment.

* Version 2 (welleydicev2) is a package containing all the game components in separate classes.

**Basic Game Rules**


* The player rolls two 6-sided dice.

* Rolling 7 or 11 on the first try is a win 
* Rolling 2, 3 or 12 on the first try is a lose 
* Any other roll on the first try becomes the player's POINT 

If the player rolled POINT, the player continues to reroll until one of two things happens:

* player wins when the player gets the POINT again

* OR loses when the player gets a 7
