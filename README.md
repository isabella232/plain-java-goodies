This repo contains a collection of java codes that I put together for fun and out of curiosity. The purpose is for each one to solve a specific problem that I encountered somewhere during the week.

1. [**Random location generator**](https://github.com/welleyloc/plain-java-goodies/blob/master/Random%20location%20generator/Location.java) returns a random location for Johnathan's Java study group to gather. 

2. [**Calculate days apart**](https://github.com/welleyloc/plain-java-goodies/blob/master/Calculate%20days%20apart/DaysApart.java) returns the number of days between a start and end date. 

3. [**Art Supply Inventory**](https://github.com/welleyloc/plain-java-goodies/blob/master/Art%20supply%20inventory/ArtSupplyInventory.java) is a JavaFx app for keeping track of art supplies to prevent the purchasing of duplicate colors.

4. [**Dice Game](https://github.com/welleyloc/plain-java-goodies/tree/master/Dice%20Game) started as a single-class assignmentment (v1), but I divided it up into several classes (v2) for the purposes of learning OO and expanding the game with multiplayer/betting capabilities in the future.
