This repo contains a collection of java codes that I put together for fun and out of curiosity. The purpose is for each one to solve a specific problem that I encountered somewhere during the week.

1. [**Random location generator**](https://github.com/welleyloc/plain-java-goodies/blob/master/Random%20location%20generator/Location.java) returns a random location for Johnathan's Java study group to gather. *Last modified: 2019-Aug-13* 

2. [**Calculate days apart**](https://github.com/welleyloc/plain-java-goodies/blob/master/Calculate%20days%20apart/DaysApart.java) returns the number of days between a start and end date. *Last modified: 2019-Aug-14*
