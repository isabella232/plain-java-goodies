#### Art Supply JavaFX App Version 1 (2019-Aug-27)
 
This app satisfies the following initial goals:

- [x] populate listview with the selected supply category

- [x] items are searchable by keyword

- [x] the CSV files can be edited to remove and add new items that will show up in the GUI

There is a small bug that will be fixed by the next version. 

Next goals:

- [ ] Make items in listview editable live
