#### Art Supply JavaFX App Version 1.1
 
Goals:

- [x] populate listview with the selected supply category

- [x] items are searchable by keyword

- [x] the CSV files can be edited to remove and add new items that will show up in the GUI

- [x] Fix bug: while a keyword is present in the text field, the listview combines items after a different category (paints/pencils) is selected. (Fixed in v1.1 2019-Sept-02)

- [ ] Make items in listview editable live

- [ ] Give user ability to add new category in combobox (generate new CSV)
